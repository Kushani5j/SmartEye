								It could be seen that many
								researches were carried out to aid the blind to engage in their day to day activities
								with confidence and free from risks. Those researches carried out beforehand had
								been able to succeed to a certain extent, but limitations and restrictions could be cited
								in them which laid the foundation for our research. After the completion of the
								background and literature survey, many gaps among the proposed solution and the
								solutions implemented beforehand could be recognized.<br>
								Most of the solutions those were implemented earlier had a similar face compared to
								the proposed solution, out of which the scope of those solutions was cited as the
								main limitation or the restriction that widened the gap between the proposed system
								and those solutions. Furthermore, features developed, or the functionalities integrated
								into those implementations were minimal when compared to the proposed solution.
								Limitations and restriction in the technologies at those times of development should
								not be disregarded, as the hardware infrastructures and software advancements
								present as per today, did not exist back then.<br>
								As mentioned beforehand, a fact that could be perceived from literature review was
								that, researches conducted formerly did not comprise a widened scope. Most of the
								researches those were conducted had a minimal targeted goal or objective. Even
								though, those implementations and researches were very valuable, effective,
								efficient, and extremely helpful, when compared to the proposed system that is to be
								implemented, it has to be cited that the proposed system has a much more widened
								scope comparative to previous systems. The reason to why the scope of the system
								matters is that, then it does not require to halt after a certain extent, by which can
								assist reach objectives or goals of a higher level.<br>
								Different products were developed as results of numerous researches, which is
								capable of catering solutions for a variety of problems faced by visionless
								individuals, of which each of them considers only a certain aspect of the whole
								picture. This is where their drawbacks can be cited, as a totally visionless individual
								need many assistive techniques to support them to carry out their day to day
								activities with the least or the minimal amount of external aid, which would allow
								them to live independently in the society. A fact that could be uncovered by
								following the literature survey was that, there was no all in one solution developed
								which is capable of providing assistance for a visionless to satisfy all their
								requirements. This is yet another underpinning circumstance that is capable of giving
								the proposed system the upper hand when considering the research gap.<br>
								When reviewing the research gap, the technological advancements that has taken
								place over the last few years cannot be disregarded, as it has been an immense
								evolution in terms of hardware infrastructure and software. Absence of such
								infrastructure during earlier research eras could also be taken into account when
								evaluating the research gap. Absence or the unawareness of Internet of Things
								concepts, microcontrollers, advanced image processing libraries, and machine
								learning algorithms could be cited as some examples of research gap widening
								factors, which are trending topics as at present, and are also used in the proposed
								system. These factors will directly or indirectly affect the final output, in which can
								cause the whole system to be less effective and efficient.
